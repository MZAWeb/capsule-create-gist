Capsule create Gist
===================

Latest stable tag: 0.1.1

Adds a "Create a Gist" icon for each entry in your [Capsule](http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/).

For now the Gist is Anonymous because I didn't want to mess with oAuth, settings screen, etc. for the first version.


In progress
-----------

1. Connect with GitHub from a settings screen in the admin so the Gists are created under your username
